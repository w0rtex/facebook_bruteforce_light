# Light bruteforce for FaceBook
FB bruteforce light is easy programm that uses fbchat and because of that it works too slow, but I'm not actually pro in python and this is my first programm with it.

To use FB Bruteforce light you should have pip fbchat and python3 installed. To install fbchat you should open terminal and type the following command:

<code>$ pip install fbchat</code> 
to install it.

When you have fbchat and python3 installed you should clone this repository to your local (run in terminal 
<code>$ git clone https://github.com/w0rtex/facebook_bruteforce_light.git</code>
Then go to directory where you cloned it and run.
<code>python FBBruteForce.py</code>.
And then just follow the instructions.
